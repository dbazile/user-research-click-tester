    (1) HACK -- In an act of desperation, I put this in to solve a specific
                problem with proper scaling of images inside of flexbox
                containers.  Since a flex container doesn't get a height, you
                can't bind the max height to 100%.  I've pinned this to the
                viewport since that's what's being targeting anyway.
